Of course the page does not provide complete list of projects, because there are a lot of them and it is hard to track them all. The framework is used a lot by different students working on theirs bachelors and master degrees, by different other researchers from different fields and by many other developers in their projects.

If you use AForge.NET framework in your project and it has a web page, you more then welcome to let the world know about it, so other people could take a look at this framework's applications.
